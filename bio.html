      <p>What started as a side gig in Ghana making sites through portals such as Wordpress and Prestashop has culminated into a full-blown desire to create userfriendly web solutions. For 5 years, I worked with clients from different industries to provide online marketing services in an environment with very little access to technology.</p>
      <p>These days, I continue to develop and hone my skills as a front-end developer. I am constantly exploring new ways of combining different scripts and design elements to create sites that are dynamic and compelling for its users. In my downtime, I love to stay active and social however, I have also been known to spend days playing CIV IV(still the best version to this day!).</p>
